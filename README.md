# Creating Fast APIs In Go Using Fiber
Fiber is a web framework that is very similar to Express, which makes it a perfect choice for any Node.js developer that decides to delve into the land of gophers. The framework is a well-designed wrapper around another framework - Fasthttp - which is considered to be one of the fastest web frameworks written in Go. Overall, these are the main advantages of Fiber:

Express-like syntax  
* Unordered sub-list  
* Highly performant, thanks to the underlying Fasthttp framework  
* Zero memory allocation  
* Easy to learn, especially if you've used Express or Koa before  
* Easy to write unit tests for, thanks to the built-in Test method  

### simple rest api application to fetch, create, update and delate todos
